# TacMapAndroidClient
This is the Android testing client for use with my TacMap-PLI fork. The fork is available at https://github.com/patrick-kbi/TacMapPLI.

# Changing server URL
To connect to your TacMap instance, you will have to change the client serverURL variable. This is located in the SocketIOConnectionInfo.java file, right at the top of the page. Simply change out my default 10.0.0.14 IP with the IP of your hosted TacMap.
